					<h1>Pan Gu and the Egg of the World</h1>
					<p>According to Chinese mythology, in the beginning a huge egg contained chaos.  The giant Pan Gu emerged from the egg and gave order to that Chaos. As he grew to 48,000 kilometers high, his skull separated the sky while his feet remained planted on the Earth.  When he died, his eyes became the Sun and the Moon, his breath the wind, his voice thunder, his limbs mountains, and his blood the roaring water. </p>

					<h1>Titans and Gods of Olympus</h1>
					<p>From Chaos emerged Gaia and Uranus who gave birth to the Titans. Two of the Titans,  Cronus and  Rhea, had many children. Fearing they would overthrow him, Cronus tried to destroy them. Zeus challenged his father and with the help of his siblings defeated Cronus and became ruler of Mount Olympus and all the gods. Prometheus shaped humans from clay while Athena blew life into them.</p>

					<h1>The Great Turtle's Island</h1>
					<p>The Iroquois believed all the world was water. A woman fell from the sky and was saved from drowning by two white swans. The ruler of water animals, Great Turtle, dispatched creatures to the depths — otter, muskrat, beaver — to bring up mud. Old lady Toad brought a mouthful of mud and placed it on Great Turtle's back. This mud grew into the world island, and offered a home for the woman who fell from the sky. </p>

					<h1>Genesis</h1>
					<p>In the Judeo-Christian tradition, God created the heavens and Earth, sky and water, land masses, seed-bearing trees, and living creatures. "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness," God said, to rule over all living things. A second story tells how humans are created first, followed by plants and animals.</p>

					<h1>Popul Vuh</h1>
					<p>In Maya origin stories, the makers in the water, the Plumed Serpent, and the makers in the sky, the Heart of the Sky, created Earth and the animals.  The animals did not show proper respect to the makers, so they were hunted.  Then, the makers created creatures from wood. Thoughtless and without emotions, they did not show respect. They too were killed.  Finally, humans — respectful and thoughtful — were created out of corn.</p>

					<h1>Modern Scientific</h1>
					<p>Suddenly, 13.8 billion years ago, all the energy in the Universe burst. Gradually this energy became matter, combining to bear the stars. These too exploded, creating galaxies and the Earth. Water was able to form, which contained the chemicals to give life to single-cell living organisms, then creatures with many cells, such as plants, and later animals. These creatures became more complex and aware, until about 100,000 years ago when humans evolved from a shared ancestor with apes.</p>
